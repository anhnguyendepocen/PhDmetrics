["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

Individuals choose \\(d\\) to maximize their utility, \\(U\\). \\(U\\) generally is written as: \\[U_{ij}=u_{ij}+\\varepsilon_{ij}\\] where: \\(u_{ij}\\) relates observed factors to the utility individual \\(i\\) receives from choosing option \\(j\\) \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) are unobserved to the econometrician but observed to the individual \\(d_{ij}=1\\) if \\(u_{ij}+\\varepsilon_{ij}&gt;u_{ij&#39;}+\\varepsilon_{ij&#39;}\\) for all \\(j&#39;\\neq j\\) 3.3 Probabilities With the \\(\\varepsilon\\)’s unobserved, the probability of individual \\(i\\) making choice \\(j\\) is given by: \\[\\begin{aligned} P_{ij}&amp;=\\Pr(u_{ij}+\\varepsilon_{ij}&gt;u_{ij&#39;}+\\varepsilon_{ij&#39;}\\forall j&#39;\\neq j)\\\\ &amp;=\\Pr(\\varepsilon_{ij&#39;}-\\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;u_{ij}-u_{ij&#39;}\\forall j&#39;\\neq j)\\\\ &amp;=\\int_{\\varepsilon}I(\\varepsilon_{ij&#39;}-\\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;u_{ij}-u_{ij&#39;}\\forall j&#39;\\neq j)f(\\varepsilon)d\\varepsilon\\end{aligned}\\] Note that, regardless of what distributional assumptions are made on the \\(\\varepsilon\\)’s, the probability of choosing a particular option does not change when we: Add a constant to the utility of all options (utility is relative to one of the options, only differences in utility matter) Multiply by a positive number (need to scale something, generally the variance of the \\(\\varepsilon\\)’s) 3.4 Variables Suppose we have: \\[\\begin{aligned} u_{i1}&amp;=\\alpha Male_i+\\beta_1 X_i + \\gamma Z_1\\\\ u_{i2}&amp;=\\alpha Male_i+\\beta_2 X_i+\\gamma Z_2\\end{aligned}\\] Since only differences in utility matter: \\[u_{i1}-u_{i2}=(\\beta_1-\\beta_2)X_i+\\gamma (Z_1-Z_2)\\] Thus, we cannot tell whether men are happier than women, but can tell whether men have a preference for a particular option over another. We can only obtain differenced coefficient estimates on \\(X\\)’s, and can obtain an estimate of a coefficient that is constant across choices only if the variable it is hitting varies by choice. "],
